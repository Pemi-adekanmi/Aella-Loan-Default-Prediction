# Aella-Loan-Default-Prediction

The goal of this project is to apply analytical techniques to build a model to predict a loan default from customers and analyse the defaulting and non-defaulting customers by using data gotten from a credit app.Therefore making data-driven decisions that can increase revenue.

**My Solution Work Through:**
1. Importing the necessary libraries and Data preprocessing
2. Analysis on Defaulted customer: made some visualizations to explore the patterns in the dataset.
3. Built Predictive Model: The models I used are Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost. Random forest is known for its ability to make highly accurate predictions important features selection. While XGBoost provides feature accuracy more than random forest and is of course faster!
4. Model Performance and Evaluation: using confusion matrix and cross validation score to check for accuracy

**Assumptions/Findings:**
The customers that are unemployed defaulted on the loan the most and this could be a good indicator when making decisions based on customers employment status.
High-earning customers show minimal risk of defaulting on their loans.

**Recommendations:**
1. Possible recommendations could be developing incentive based plans for high-earning customers 
2. Creating personalized services for customers at certain organizations if company information can be provided
3. Unemployed customers should not have access to large amount of loans.
4. Offer bonuses to high-earning customers as well as loyal customers to keep them.
