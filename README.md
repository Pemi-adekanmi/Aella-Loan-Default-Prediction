# Aella-Loan-Default-Prediction

The goal of this project is to apply analytical techniques to build a model to predict a loan default from customers and analyse the defaulting and non-defaulting customers by using data gotten from a credit app.Therefore making data-driven decisions that can increase revenue.

**My Soultion Work Through:**
1. Importing the necessary libraries and Data preprocessing
2. Analysis on Defaulted customer: made some visualizations to explore the patterns in the dataset and I realize that 70% of the defaulters and unemployed, 20% are those whose annual salary are less than 700000
3. 
4. Built Predictive Model: The models I used are Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost. Random forest is known for its ability to make highly accurate predictions important features selection. While XGBoost provides feature accuracy more than random forest and is of course faster!
5. Model Performance and Evaluation: using confusion matrix and cross validation score.
